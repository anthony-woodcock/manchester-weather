Webpage that gives users the current weather in Manchester using the Open Weather API to get the weather. 

https://openweathermap.org/appid

Used XMLHttpRequest and the DOM to retrieve and parse the data from that URL. 

Used the temperature, description , wind ,image and humidity properties. Modified the kelvin temperature to create celcius and farenheit. 

Task gave me a better understanding of how API's and XMLHttpRequest work, as well as modifying data that is nested in objects/arrays.
